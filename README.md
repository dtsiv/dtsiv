Hi, I am Dmitry.
I am interested in cross-platform c++ development for IA32 architecture.
Qt5.6.3 is no more supported but I choose it for its WinXP deployment option.
For me it more appropriate to build executables statically and pick suitable Qt plugins.
It is great that Qt has open source and I can compile it with my personal preferences.
My C++ code can be viewed on GitHub.
Many thanks to Qt and Git))
